## 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis using Power BI
# A data storytelling project built on the iconic Titanic dataset to uncover the patterns behind passenger survival. This project demonstrates my end-to-end data analysis skills — from cleaning and transforming raw data to building an interactive Power BI dashboard with actionable insights.

# 🔍 Key Insights  
💡 Only 38.4% of passengers survived the Titanic disaster.  
👩 Females (74.2%) had a far higher survival rate than males (18.9%).  
🧒 Children aged 0–12 had the highest survival odds across all age groups.  
🎟️ 1st Class passengers had more than 2.5x survival rate compared to 3rd Class.  
👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Medium-sized families (2–4 members) were more likely to survive than individuals or large families.  
🚫 Big families in 3rd Class had the lowest odds, with survival rates as low as 7.4%.  
🛳️ Port of Embarkation mattered — passengers from Port C had the highest survival rate.  
📈 Combination of Age + Class + Family Size heavily influenced outcomes.
